Project Title
Mancala AI Player

Summary
The project is a Python-based game of Mancala, in which a player can play against a computer. The computer uses MIN MAX and alpha beta algorithms to make optimal moves and attempt to win the game.

Background
Mancala is an ancient game played in many cultures around the world. The game involves moving stones or seeds around a board with hollows, and the winner is determined by who has the most seeds at the end of the game.

Mancala is a popular game with many variations, but playing against a computer player can be challenging. Therefore, this project aims to create an AI player to make the game more interesting and provide a good challenge to the user.

How is it used?
To play the game, a user can simply run the Python script and follow the prompts on the command line to make their moves. The computer player will automatically make its own moves using the MIN MAX and alpha beta algorithms.

The game can be played in any environment that supports Python. It is designed for any user who enjoys playing games and wants a challenge.

Data sources and AI methods
The project does not require any external data sources. The AI player uses MIN MAX and alpha beta algorithms to make decisions based on the current state of the board and the available moves.

Challenges
The project does not solve any specific problem, but rather aims to provide an entertaining and challenging game for the user. However, some ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this, such as ensuring that the AI player does not use any unfair advantages or cheat.

What next?
The project could be expanded to include more advanced AI algorithms or additional features such as a graphical user interface. In order to expand the project, more advanced skills in artificial intelligence and game development may be required.

Acknowledgments
The project was inspired by the game of Mancala and the desire to create an AI player for the game. The AI algorithms used in the project were inspired by various resources on artificial intelligence and game development.
